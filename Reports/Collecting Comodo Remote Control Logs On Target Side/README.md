Hi 
The script helps you to Collect all Comodo Remote Control Log on target side i.e(CRC Installed Side ) and transfer the files to  SFTP server with Individual User on Endpoint Desktop.


Define  kayako_ticket_number="XXXXXXXXXX"   

Script should run as "System User " 

The Output File will Transfer with the name  as  Ticketnumber_CRCLog-TargetSide_Computername_Time

For Example :

GOI-22-2680_CRCLog-TargetSide_C1-TEST02_2017_10_30_02_05_44.zip
