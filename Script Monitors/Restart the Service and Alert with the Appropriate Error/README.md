Hi,

Please refer this script to monitor the service status 

if the service was stopped then the script tries to restart the service and send the appropriate alert.

Input:

Service = Mention the service name to restart.

Example:

Service = "ITSMService"

Please refer the wiki guide for how to use the custom monitoring scripts:
