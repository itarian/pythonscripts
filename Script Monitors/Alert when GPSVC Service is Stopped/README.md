Hi,

Please use the script for monitoring the "gpsvc" service (Group policy client) when the service is stopped alert will be generated and service is started.

 

Note: Please run the below script as custom monitoring for the expected result.

Refer the below wiki topic that tells how to run it as a custom monitoring script.
