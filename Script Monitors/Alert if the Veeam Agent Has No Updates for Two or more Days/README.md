Hi 

The script helps to generate the alert if Veeam Backup is not scheduled for last two or more days

define your own alert_nobackup_days for generating the alert.

Example : alert_nobackup_days=2  #alerts if no backup for 2 or more days

Script can run in both "Logged in " and "System User"
