This Script will update your CCS version to the Specified version of CCS based on the input links (4 links). 

To update to the Specified version of CCS we need four links to binaries files for following files :

    update.7z
    cfpconfg.exe
    7za.dll
    cmdres.dll

Run this Script as "SYSTEM USER"

Note:

In this script, we have provided example URLs from Comodo that will always update to latest CCS version.

You can get these files for the intended version from Comodo and host it in your location.

CCS should be installed in the endpoint.

This script will restart the endpoint, so please save your works.
