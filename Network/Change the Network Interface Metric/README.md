Hi

 This script is used to change the network interface metric by the reference of interface index.

  It will support above windows 8 version.

 Input:

metric -> mention the metric value to change.
index -> mention the index to change the corresponding metric.

Example:

metric= '77'
index= '1'

It will run as both system user and Logged in user.
