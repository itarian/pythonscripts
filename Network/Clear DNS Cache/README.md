Certain operating systems and DNS clients will automatically cache IP addresses and other DNS results, this is done in order to speed up subsequent requests to the same hostname. Sometimes bad results will be cached and therefore need to be cleared from the cache in order for you to communicate with the host correctly.

Thus the script will help you to clear the DNS Cache

Note:

Please run the script as "System User"
