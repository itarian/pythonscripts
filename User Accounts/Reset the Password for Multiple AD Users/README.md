Hi

Please refer the script to change the password to multiple AD users.

Note:

Run as System user

Edit Parameters:

uN =[ 'Administrator','user1','user2']  ## provide the AD user's name. No of usernames should match the no of passwords.
pWD = ['******','******','******'] ## password setup is based on policy requirement. the complex policy does not accept the simple password!
