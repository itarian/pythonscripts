Hi,

This script locks the windows after X minutes of the idleness where there should be no input from the keyboard or mouse and requires the user to enter the password to get back in.

This will reset the idle time. when the time off is met with the provided condition the system will lock.

Note:

Run as a System user.
This script must be restarted once to apply the changes.
Edit parameters:

 timeoff=120. Provide time off only in seconds as per your need.
