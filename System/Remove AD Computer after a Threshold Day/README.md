Hi,

This script will remove the AD computer if the login time of the AD computer exceeds after threshold specified days (i.e, 30 days).

i.e, For Example:

rem_value='30' # Provide the days to remove the AD computer.

Note:

This script will be run as auto-remediation for "Disable AD Computer after a threshold day"
