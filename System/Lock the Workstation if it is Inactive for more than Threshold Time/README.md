Hi All,

Please use this procedure to lock the workstation if logged in user is not active for more than a threshold time. 

The input parameter is threshold time in minutes for which endpoint can be left open without user activities.

For example, 

threshold_time= 10  #in minutes 

 

Note: The script works well if run as logged in user
