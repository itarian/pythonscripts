Hi,

This script is used to Update the GPO Policy settings at the end point.

It can run in both as the "system user " and as "logged in user".

Note:

GPO(Group Policy Objects) is a collection of settings defined for a group of users. It is associated with Active Directory  Domain and local directories.
Group Policy Update (gpupdate) usually updates all local and Active Directory-based Group Policy settings, including security settings.
