This script is to check whether your target Windows machine has the Registry key or not.

The Registry or Windows Registry contains information, settings, options, and other values for programs and hardware installed on all versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems.

For example, when a program is installed, a new subkey containing settings like a program's location, its version, and how to start the program, are all added to the Windows Registry.

 

The script can run by both logged in user or system user
