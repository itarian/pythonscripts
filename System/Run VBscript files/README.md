1. This script procedure creates temporary VB script file (.vbs format), run it, capture the output and delete that file finally

2.We can run the script procedure as either "system user" or "loggedin user" according to the requirement.

3. If we run script as logged in user, we need to ensure that user actively logged on.

4. Replace variable content of "vbs" with your custom script (in-between triple quotes)
