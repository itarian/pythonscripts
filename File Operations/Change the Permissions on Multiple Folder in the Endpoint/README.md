path="C:\Users\Win1032\Desktop\New folder (2)" #please provide the path to the directory or folder
user="win1032"   #please provide the username

permission="F"   #Please provide any one of the following permission rights

                  #F - full access
                  #M - modify access
                  #RX - read and execute access
                  #R - read-only access
